アドベンチャー　2019年12月20日　
 過去に起きた忘れられない話</strong>
<em>（ちょっと書きすぎてごめんなさい🙇分かりにくれば、英語版English O.K.!を付けていました）</em></p>
<p>今年の夏、私は日本に留学しに行きました。その時に私は不安な感じを持っていました。日本に行ったことがないし、一人で外国に行ったことがないし、その時まであんまり日本語を話すのが練習がないし、私は怖かったです。でも、その理由の中には一番大事な理由ではありません。私は、六年間くらい日本語を勉強しました。「貝さん、どうして日本語を勉強するの？」と聞かさせて頃、私はよく「音楽ですから」と答えて、でも嘘を作っていました。特別理由がなかったです。もちろん、日本語を勉強したらいい音楽を聴きちゃって漫画も気になって、その気合いのために日本語勉強して続け決めたんで、でもそれは理由ではない。日本に行く前に、たくさん外国人みたいに、私は日本のイメージが持っていました。日本に行ったら、　そのイメージが壊れちゃったら、私はどうするですか。</p>
<p>でも、伊丹空港から出て、不安な感じが消えて、 安心な感じができました。東大阪にホストファミリーの家に住んで、大阪の大学に二週間行きました。道頓堀に食べに行ったり、大学の女子とカラオケしたり、ホストファミリーとご飯を食べたりして、すごく楽しすぎたです。ホストお母さんは小学先生だし、私が小学生と他の先生を話せました。私は１８５センチ白人ですから、二年生だちがびっくりしてちょっと怖がっていて、でも自己紹介したらフレンドリーになってしまいました。あの日、運動会があって、予約座席から見ました。小学生ですから、形成の精度がアメリカ高校生よりとても上手です。本当にびっくりしました！ホストファミリーと大阪城に行ったり、寿司を食べたり、温泉に行ったりしました。実は、温泉にちょっと恥ずかしと思ったので行きたくなかったで、でも行った良かったです。すごく楽しかったです！何回も色々な居酒屋にちょっと酔って忘れましたw。</p>
<p>残念ですから、二週間がもうしまいました。大阪から出かなければいけませんでした。留学ですが、一週間観光しました。京都に金閣寺や龍安寺や二条城、奈良に春日大社や奈良公園や東大寺や平城宮、姫路城に行ってとても疲れました！広島に二日間について、原発ドームと平和記念資料館に行ったら、日本語で英語も説明できない感じができました。本当に感動しました。広島にもアメリカ軍隊の友達に初めて出会いしました。友達と会う初めてってどう言う意味って、実は彼はオンライン友です。一回も会ったことがありませんでした！一緒に広島城と本通に行って、一蘭に食べました。</p>
<p>その後で、厳島神社に行って、鎌倉に新幹線で行きました。（曇ってから富士山が見せられない(⇀‸↼‶)）新幹線が偉いぃ〜！カリフォルニアには二十年間住んで二回電車に乗りました。ここにも新幹線みたいな電車がナイスアイデア（！）と思います。まぁ、鎌倉に長谷寺や鎌倉大仏高徳院に行きました。それで、茨城県の水戸の常磐大学に一週間行きました。我が大学と常磐大学と学期留学プログラムがあるし、この旅行は紹介のために国際寮に住んでいました。水戸に数人ALTsと喋ったり授業に手伝ってあげたりしました。過去に英語先生になるとかちゃんと考えて、今までも知らん、CM「コンストラクタ・マネジメン」就職してめんどくさくなる決めやすいかもね〜！とにかく、水戸から東京に行って、普通の観光者所に、天草や秋葉原や新宿や渋谷とか。東京が素晴らしですが、時間が短くて疲れて過ぎて、寝て帰りたかったですw。</p>
<p>他の外国に行ったことがあって、でもその国の中で、日本は一番と思います。アメリカから不安な感じが持って出発しまして、アメリカまで安心な感じが持って到着しました。</p>
<p>その時に私は気がついた。日本に行く前に、理由が必要ではなかった。
どうして日本語を勉強して知らない。
どうして日本に行ったも知らない。
でも、一つ事が知っている。</p>
<p>日本に行ったこと良かったです。</p>
<p>その瞬間が絶対忘れられない。

A memorable story from my past
(Sorry I wrote a very long entry, here is the English version for those who may not understand)
In the summer of this year, I did a study abroad trip to Japan.  At that time, I had a very uneasy feeling about the trip.  I had neither been to Japan before, traveled abroad alone, nor had very much practice actually speaking Japanese before.  However, none of the reasons we the biggest reason for my unease.  At that point, I had already been studying Japanese for about 6 years. People would ask me “Kai, why are you studying Japanese?” and I would usually answer with “Because of the music”, however, that was merely a lie.  There was no special reason why I started to study Japanese. Of course, while I was studying Japanese, I found some great music, and become a fan of reading Manga, but those were only hobbies that helped me continue my studies, not the reasons why I started. Before I went to Japan, just like so many other foreigners, I had my own ideas about Japan.  If I go to Japan and those ideas are shattered, what would I do?
However, as soon as I was leaving Itami Airport, that uneasy feeling was replaced by a feeling of ease.  I stayed with a host family in Higashiosaka and went to a college in Osaka for 2 weeks.  Going to eat in Dotonbori, doing Karaoke with the girls at the college, and having meals with my host family was incredibly fun.  Because my host mother was an elementary school teacher, I got to go to her school and talk to students and teachers.  Because I am a 185cm white guy, the 2nd grade students I talked to were very surprised and some were a bit scared, but they became friendly after we introduced ourselves.  One day, there was a sports festival at the school, and I got to watch from the reserved seats.  Even though they were highschoolers, the precision and accuracy of the formations they did were better than what American high schoolers could do. I was extremely surprised.　I went to Osaka Castle with my host family, we ate sushi, and went to an onsen.  I actually didn’t really want to go to an onsen because I thought it would be too embarrassing, but I was very glad that I did. It was extremely fun and relaxing.  We went drinking excessively at Izakayas more times than I can remember.
Unfortunately, my two weeks in Osaka was spent and I had to leave. Even though I was on a ‘study abroad trip’, we took off a week for sightseeing. We went to many other places during my trip as well; in Kyoto to Kinkakuji Shrine, Ryoanji Rock Garden, Nijo Castle, in Nara to Todaiji, Katsuga Taisha, Heijo Palace, and to Himeji Castle. We walked everywhere and I was very tired.  For the two days I spent in Hiroshima, we went to the Atomic Dome and the Peace Memorial museum, and I can’t explain the feeling I felt in English or Japanese.  It was very moving.  I met up with a friend I have in the US Marines who is stationed in IwaKuni for the first time.  “What do you mean you met your friend for the first time”, you may ask, but actually this is because he is an online friend of mine, I had never met him in person before!  We went to Hiroshima Castle, walked along Hondori street, and ate at Ichiran Ramen.
After Hiroshima, we went to Itsukushima Shrine, and then took the bullet train to Kamakura.  Along the way, I didn’t get to see Mt. Fuji because it was cloudy. The Shinkansen was amazing! I have lived in California for 20 years, and I’ve only ever taken a train twice.  A train like the Shinkansen would be great over here.  Anyway,  In Kamakura we visited Hasedera Shrine and Kotokuin. After that, we spent a week at Tokiwa University in Mito, Ibaraki Prefecture.  My college has a semester long study abroad program with Tokiwa, so for this trip we stayed in the international dorms to introduce ourselves.  In Mito, I met and talked to a lot of ALTs and helped in their classes.  In the past I had thought about teaching English, but even up until now I still don’t know about it, maybe if construction management job hunting gets rough it’ll be easy to make up my mind.  Anyways, we left Mito for Tokyo, and went to all the typical touristy sights, such as Amakusa, Akhabara, Shinjuku, and Shibuya.  Tokyo was incredible but because we were only there for a short time and I was extremely tired from walking everywhere I just wanted to go home and sleep!
I have been to other foregin countries, but among them, Japan was the best.   I left America with a feeling of unease and returned with one of ease.
At that time I had realised something.  I didn’t need a reason before going to Japan. 
I didn’t know why I studied Japanese.
I didn’t know why I went to Japan.
But there was one thing I did know.</p>
<p>I was glad that I went.</p>
<p>And that is the moment that I will never forget.</p></div>
